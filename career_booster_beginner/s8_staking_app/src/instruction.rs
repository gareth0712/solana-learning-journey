//  Remember a good rule of development: Plan-Do-Check-Act, so letâ€™s plan what kind of instructions would need our staking application:

// We definitely need:
// 1. To initialize our staking pool, so we have a place to store information about the pool;
// 2. An instruction to Create users and Stake, so we can store how much concrete user have staked, the timestamp of the last stake, and how much rewards a user has earned;
// 3. allow a user to withdraw his stake with Unstake;
// 4. Claim earned rewards.
