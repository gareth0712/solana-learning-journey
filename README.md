# Solana Learning Journey

This repo is showcases learning resources I found for Solana and tracks my learning journey. I will
be updating this repo with my progress and resources I find useful. Any feedback or suggestions are
welcome. If any of the resources are outdated or incorrect, please let me know.

# Solana

TODO:

1. Summarize things learnt and create a summary below
2. Study MultiSig
3. Delegate Wallet

## Accounts

![Solana Accounts Flow](/assets/solana-account.png)

## Security checklist

1. Missing signer checks: if an instruction should only be available to a restricted set of
   entities, but the program does not verify that the call has been signed by the appropriate entity
   (e.g., by checking AccountInfo::is_signer ).
2. Missing ownership checks: for accounts that are not supposed to be fully user-controlled, the
   program does not check the AccountInfo::owner field.
3. Missing rent exemption checks: all Solana accounts holding an Account, Mint, or Multisig must
   contain enough SOL to be considered rent exempt. Otherwise, the accounts may fail to load.
4. Signed invocation of unverified programs: the program does not verify the pubkey of any program
   called via the invoke_signed() API.
5. Solana account confusions: the program fails to ensure that the account data has the type it
   expects to have.
6. Re-initiation with cross-instance confusion
7. Arithmetic overflow/underflows: If an arithmetic operation results in a higher or lower value,
   the value will wrap around with twoâ€™s complement.
8. Numerical precision errors: numeric calculations on floating point can cause precision errors and
   those errors can accumulate.
9. Loss of precision in the calculation: numeric calculations on integer types such as division can
   lose precision.
10. Incorrect calculation: for example, incorrect numerical computation to copy/paste errors
11. Casting truncation
12. Exponential complexity in calculation
13. Missing freeze authority checks
14. Insufficient SPL-Token account verification
15. Over/under-payment of loans
